# Youtube Analysis Part 2: Database Views and SQL Queries

In the first part of the project, I focused on extracting data from the YouTube API and loading it into an RDS Amazon Web Service PostgreSQL Database. Once the data was successfully loaded, I created two views to make it easier to analyze the information I needed.

## Database Views
The first view I created was for the economical channels within the data. This view allows for easy access to information specifically related to channels that focus on economic topics. The second view was for the videos of these channels, providing a more detailed look at the content being produced.

## SQL Queries
With the database views in place, I used SQL queries to answer specific questions related to the data. These queries showcased a range of skills including basic queries, joins, aggregations, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and partitions. The results of these queries, along with the questions and the queries themselves, have been documented in a PDF file for reference.

By leveraging SQL queries, I was able to gain valuable insights from the data and provide meaningful analysis for the project.
